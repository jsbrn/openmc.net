	<center><b>What is OpenMC?</b></center><br>
	OpenMC is a custom vanilla Minecraft server that aims to fix many of the problems that come with most servers today. The goal is to give people a friendly, no-bullshit place to play the game with their friends.
	OpenMC is as close to single-player as you can get, while still protecting players from griefing and other abusive behaviors.
	<br><br>
	<center><b>What makes it different from other servers?</b></center>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Easy land claiming: </b>Place a banner to protect the area around you from others. No commands or permissions required.</li>
		<li><b>Randomized spawns: </b>Everyone has the option to start in an untouched part of the world, away from other players.</b></li>
		<li><b>Friend groups: </b>Group up with your friends to build together on the same plots.</li>
		<li><b>Player reputation: </b>Players gain reputation the longer they play. Hurting others (or their creations) will also hurt your reputation. 
				When reputation drops too low, you will be banned.</li>
		<li><b>No chat spam: </b>Choose whether you want to see messages from people around you, friends or everybody on the server.
				<i>Server announcements are rare and only used for important things.</i></li>
		<li><b>NO WORLD RESETS: </b>Losing your builds every few weeks defeats the purpose of playing.
			<i>The only time the world will reset is if the majority of members vote for it.</i></li>
	</ol>
